# Java JVM

using java to implement a simple jvm 8

# Start from an example of running a java program

Mostly, you run own java program like follow

```shell
java -jar java-program-package.jar
```

Before use command above, one needs to set up System Environment of **Java Runtime Environment**, like `JAVA_HOME`，`PATH`, otherwise the terminal would show like follow

```shell
-bash: java: command not found
```

After setting up System Environment well, you have a Java Runtime Environment to run your java program.
